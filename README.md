# ENGAGE
Welcome to the the repository for ENGAGE, my PhD research project which uses a participatory modelling methodology to develop a catchment-scale sediment dynamics model. This model is based within the Python programming language and situated within the ArcGIS software suite. 

ENGAGE requires ArcGIS 10.1 to be installed, including python 2.7 and numpy.

I am a third year PhD researcher at the University of the West of England, with a passion for rivers, geomorphology, modelling, stakeholder engagement and scientific communication.
